            <p><strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong> (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and politician who served as the <span class="text-span">11th President</span> of India from 2002
              to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the <span class="text-span-2">Defense Research
                and
                Development Organization</span> (DRDO) and <span class="text-span-3">Indian Space Research Organization</span> (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space program and military missile development efforts. He thus came
              to
              be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organizational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
              the
              first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
            <p>
              Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely
              referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
              civilian
              honor.</p>

            <p>While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the
              funeral
              ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honors.</p>
